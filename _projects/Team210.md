# Project Description

  There is a lack of standardizatin in reporting of 210Pb dating of sediment cores. Our objectives are several fold.
  1) to asses current pracitces in reporting through a literature review 
  2) Recommend minimum reporting requirements for authors to ensure models can be reproduced and for adquate uncertainty assesment
  3) Using recommendations for repoding to advise database structuring for geochronology components of respository records
  4) Outreach to the academic community to promote best practices
  
  
# Project Status June 21 2016
  *Drafting of the writing commenced - target journals: Quaternary Geochronology, Journal of Palaeolimnology, QR, QI
  *Manual lit review is ongoing 50 records of target 100 plus lead-210 dating papers
  *Initial GeoDeepDive search found 5000+ papers mentioning 210-lead dating - need to further examine to complement the manual lit review to contextualise how dating has been recorded
  *Draft template for minumum reporting requirements completed (Marco and Janice) soon to be on IEDA (http://www.earthchem.org/data/templates)
  *Still need to engage database and developers to broaden scope of paper to ensure compatibility with data-user perspectives
  
  thus we are open to additional co-authors to help complete the draft manuscript - please email the group above!!
